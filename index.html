  <p><em>Nameless</em> is the culmination of a three-year discovery of grief and hurt and all the things that impact sexual assault victims/casualties/survivors in their daily lives.</p>
  <p>It is my ultimate goal to create a program that belong in the concert hall and will provoke conversation and introspection from the audience.</p>

    <h3>Preexisting rep:</h3>
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><em><strong>Wild Winged One</strong></em> - Liza Lim (1966-  )
        </p>
        <p>This piece for solo trumpet and Wacky Whistle explores extended techniques in the upper register.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em><strong>musica invisible</strong></em> - Cecilia Arditto (1966-  )
        </p>
        <p>Arditto's piece for solo trumpet and flugelhorn involves speaking through the horn, producing a variety of sounds, and distorting timbre via a bowl of water.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em><strong>Parker Notch</strong></em> - Peter Ablinger (1959-  )
        </p>
        <p><em>Parker Notch</em> is among Ablinger's most well-known works, but I'll be using it as a metaphor for the frustration a survivor feels when she is drowned out by disbelievers and those who think she deserved what happened to her.

          </p>
          <p><em>Stanford swimmer</em> is a critique of the way accused and admitted rapists and sexual predators are continually named by their accolades despite their crimes. It will utilize Max/MSP.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em><strong>My Problem/Not My Problem</strong>, work in progress</em> - Megan DeJarnett</p>
          <p>A war within Nameless about whether or not she's justified in asking others to help keep her safe.</p>

        <li>
          <p><em><strong>Some Days are Good Days</strong>, work in progress</em> - Megan DeJarnett</p>

  <h2>BIO:</h2>
</div>
  <div class="container3">
    <p>Megan DeJarnett is a Los Angeles-based composer-trumpeter who has spent her life in the thrall of a good story. Throughout her musical training, she has prioritized communication—the composer telling a story to the performer or audience through the score, the performer commenting on the music aurally or visually, and the audience’s response to a piece all figure prominently in her creative practice. Megan has dedicated herself to the creation and performance of new music, collaborating with composers around the world as a soloist and a co-founder of Phantom Collective, a student-run chamber brass ensemble at CalArts. She has performed with Wayne Bergeron and Summit Brass and premiered new works across the United States, including at the 2016 National Trumpet Competition. Her primary teachers include Matt Barbier, Kotoka Suzuki, Jody Rockmaker, and Marc Lowenstein. Megan’s creative work focuses on bridging the gaps between composer, performer, and audience through physical, idiomatic, and textual means.</p>
    <p>Megan holds a BM in Theory and Composition from Arizona State University and is currently in pursuit of her MFA in the Performer-Composer program at CalArts. She is constantly seeking out new collaborators; her work can be found <a href="https://megandejarnett.com" target="_blank">on her website</a>.</p>
